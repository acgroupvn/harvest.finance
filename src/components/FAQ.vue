                <ul>
                    <li>We were looking for a convenient way to farm the latest projects that were producing different reward tokens. The process was highly manual and inconvenient for people that had a normal job and didnâ€™t want to keep up with DeFi 24/7.</li>
                    <li>Gas prices have been really high, and it was expensive to farm by ourselves, so we pooled our funds together to try to save on gas. We decided to build the solution that we were looking for ourselves, and hopefully will help many others.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Yield farming is not going away, and gas prices are not getting lower. Our goal is to simply provide an easy way for people to benefit, and make your hard work much easier, while looking for safe projects to add to the farming repertoire.</li>
                    <li>We plan to add more assets over time. DAO funds can be used to add useful integrations, provide bug bounties and pay for security audits, and even fund projects to build on top of Harvest and add value to FARM holders.</li>

            <div class="harvest__faq-1-question">How does the Profit Share work? Where does the 30% come from?</div>
            <span class="harvest__faq-1-nd">
                 <p style="margin-top:0px;">The Harvest Cooperative is comprised of humble farmers pooling resources together in order to earn profits and become the largest industrialized farming co-op in the world. When farmers deposit, Harvest automatically farms the highest yield with these deposits. 70% of these profits are distributed back to the depositors. The other 30% of profits are used to market buy FARM tokens en masse. These FARM tokens are then distributed proportionally to the Harvest Cooperative who stakes FARM tokens in the profit share pool. This aligns long term incentives with our FARM holders.</p>
                 <p>In addition, the Profit Share pool also receives weekly FARM emissions from the total supply of 690,420. The breakdown of emissions can be found in the weekly Medium updates from the team.</p>
